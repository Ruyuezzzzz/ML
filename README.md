# ML_final project for mental health survey in tech place
### This project analyzed the Mental Health Survey in Tech data to identify the most important factors in whether somebody will seek treatment for mental health.
### The problem to deal with is using the data, what are the most important factors in whether or not somebody will seek treatment for mental health? Once we have identified them, can we determine who did not seek treatment but should? With how much accuracy?
### To find the the most important factors, Logistoc regression cofficients, Recursive Feature Elimination, RandomForest feature importances were used.
### For the prediction to seek treatment, logsitic Regression, Random forest, kNN, Boosting,Bagging were adapted.Then the voting methods and use cross_val_score to calculate the average accuracy of each modelto select the best model
