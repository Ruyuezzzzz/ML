# ML_final project for mental health survey in tech place
This project analyzed the Mental Health Survey in Tech data to identify the most important factors in whether somebody will seek treatment for mental health.
The problem to deal with is using the data, what are the most important factors in whether or not somebody will seek treatment for mental health? Once we have identified them, can we determine who did not seek treatment but should? With how much accuracy?
